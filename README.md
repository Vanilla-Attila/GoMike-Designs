# Optimization of GoMike Designs 

This project is part of my learning journey to becoming a web developer at **[Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/)**.

I optimized an existing webpage to make it rank and perform better.

I improved the page by changing

* Lang attribute
* h1
* Eliminate render-blocking resources 
* Preload key requests
* Give images proper height and width
* Convert images
* Update jquery and bootstrap
* Improving color contrast ratio 
* Use proper semantic tags
* Minifing files...
